      "Skegness is only twenty minutes drive from Jane & Eric's house so we took Leo and Holly on a trip to the seaside. School holidays meant that we encountered enough traffic to add forty minutes onto our journey. Despite masses of holidaymakers it was still easy to find a parking space near the sea front.",
      "There was a Ferris wheel next to where we parked so we made that our first port of call. Leo enjoyed the vantage point which overlooked the sand, sea and plethora of fun fair amusements. Holly wasn't particularly phased by her first Ferris wheel experience. Daddy was happy to spot an attraction in the distance where you can drive little boats along a canal.",
      "We sought out the little boats after lunch. Daddy empathised with Tim West from Great Canal Journeys when he first put reverse gear to the test only to feel our little pink craft continue to drift slowly forwards into a tunnel blocked by an oncoming boat. We soon got more fluent with the controls and Leo helped avoid subsequent crashes by using his life jacket whistle to ensure our presence was known to all around.",
      "After a wander through the maze of lights, music and sugar-filled air we made our way to the beach. Leo was joyous about the little windmill on a stick that we bought him. Daddy sat with Holly and the buggy while mummy took Leo for a paddle in the sea."
