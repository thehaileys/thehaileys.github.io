      "On our last full day visiting Jane an Eric we took a day trip to Cleethorpes. It featured similar beach and ammusments to Skegness but on a smaller scale. It had been raining heavily for the journey but thankfully dried up when we stopped.",
      "Eric had recommended that we try Steels Corner House Restaurant for fish and chips. We liked the quaint tea room style and were very impressed by the size of the fish that they serve. Leo sampled mushy peas for the first time but was more interested in the fish.",
      "After lunch we walked up the promenade to find Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway. Leo was very exited by the incredibly small train. We rode to the end of the line but came back to the middle station as there seemed to be more to explore. Holly wanted a feed so daddy was happy to discover a tiny pub at the station, The Signal Box Inn.",
      "By the time we got the train back to the edge of town and walked back down the promenade Leo and Holly were both sleeping. It had been a fun day exploring somewhere new."
