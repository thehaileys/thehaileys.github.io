      "Jane and Eric welcomed us with a hearty dinner. Afterwards Holly lay on the living room floor threatening to roll over for the first time. Leo eagerly helped daddy to set up an airbed in his room.",
      "It took a while to get Leo to a relaxed and sleepy state after his milk and story. When daddy nipped out to fill his water he jumped up and insisted on coming along rather than being left in the unfamiliar room. He did feel close to going to sleep but then Mummy took a jug of water from the fridge and while attempting to fill his cup knocked off the jug lid and poured ice cold water all over Leo's head. It was a moment worthy of Fawlty Towers but Leo didn't see the funny side.",
      "The next day we found a playpark behind the house where Leo had lots of early morning fun. We met a man tending to chickens on his allotment on the way back and he gave Leo a fresh egg. Leo had fun with his toys and ball back in the garden but found even more enjoyment playing with the clothes pole.",
      "We were well fed as usual on our second night with local Lincolnshire sausages and mash. A pudding was not required but Jane's trifle was too good to pass up.",
      "On Sunday Jane & Eric took us to a nearby holiday park for a lovely lunch. Later that evening Eric taught Leo some foraging skills in the land behind the house. Lots of ripe blackberries were growing from thorny vines and Leo ate them faster than Eric could retrieve them."
