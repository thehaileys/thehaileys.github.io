    "We got a good sleep the night before we had to go home and had plenty of time for a last relaxing breakfast on the balcony. We tried local bakery whose pain au chocolat was twice the size of a regular one and ten times as chocolately.",
    "There was rain and lightning on our drive to the airport but the Jeep made light work of the journey.",
    "The airport is basic but we were onto the plane and in the air quite promptly.",
    "Leo didnt sleep but was fairly easy to entertain. He did throw one tantrum where he impatiently demanded mummy take him to see the toilet.",
    "Holly was no bother as usual, giving out her signature smiles to Daddy and nearby passengers.",
    "Leo didn't fade when we landed. He excitedly ran towards passport control and showed his usual enthusiasm for the tensa barriers.",
    "Overall we had a fantastic trip. Crete was beautiful. There was plenty to do without feeling too busy. The Greek food was varied and tasty. We expect to go back."
