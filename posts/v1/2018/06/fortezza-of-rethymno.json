      "Daddy has no need for a visit to the gym after pushing a heavy buggy up the steep slope to the Rethymno Fortezza entrance in the midday heat. The climb was rewarded with a wonderful view of Rethymno old town.",
      "Leo was sleeping and Holly wanted fed as soon as we entered the fort so mummy set up camp in an amphitheatre while Andy and daddy explored.",
      "The fort felt very barren in the intense heat but did offer spectacular views. There was sparce vegitation including a cactus engraved with daddy's initials.",
      "We were quite shocked by the drastic contrast of an underground vault we happened to stumble upon. Inisde the cool chamber was an array of colourful artwork. Relaxing music was playing and three cats were napping behind a canvas. More artwork was to be found in the central mosque."
