      "After dropping Leo and daddy at their stag do villa mummy and Holly made their way to the hen do. Thankfully the girl's villa was on a recognised road so much easier to find.",
      "Holly was the youngest in attendence. The women were all chilling around the pool and mummy took the opportunity to give Holly her first dip. Holly was completely unphased by the cooling water. Her expression remained neither overly happy nor sad during the experience.",
      "Mummy enjoyed catching up with old friends, particularly Marce who has been living in Austrailia for the last few years. Getting to meet Maria's Greek friends and family was nice too.",
      "Later in the evening some Cretan dances were practiced in preparation for the wedding. Mummy also had an attempt at teaching some Scottish ceilidh moves with mixed success."
