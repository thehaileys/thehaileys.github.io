      "Our AirBnB was only two blocks back from the middle of Rethymno beach. We decided to take a wander up the promenade towards the fort.",
      "Leo was keen to do some walking so we let him stroll in the shade of the beachfront shops and restaurants. He was captivated by the fish pedicure tanks that we walked past.",
      "Eventually Leo's little legs got tired and he started trying to sit on the ground. He got a startle when he tried to crawl from the shade onto some paving stones which had been roasting in full sunshine. Thankfully he agreed to travel in the buggy for a time so we could pick up our pace.",
      "It didn't take long for us to get to the old town. There was a nice Venetian harbour including an impressive lighthouse and a great view back to the main part of town."
