      "We were only in the area to visit Reptisland but found Melidoni to be a very pleasant lunch stop. The town is tiny but has a couple of cafes.",
      "We ate in Carob and Olive and found their traditional Greek dishes to be delicious. The outside dining setting with cooling mist sprayers was very idyllic."
