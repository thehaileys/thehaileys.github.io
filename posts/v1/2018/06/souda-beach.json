      "A number of guests made their way to Plakias Beach the day after the wedding. The drive through the mountains from Rethymno to the south of the island was stunning. We were in particular awe as we drove through a valley flanked with sheer rock towering straight upwards on either side of the road.",
      "Red flags were up due to the water conditions at Plakias beach so we made a last minute switch to Souda Beach just a little further down the coast. The road to this beach was too steep and windy for busses to make it so felt quieter and more relaxed.",
      "Galini Tavern was a good lunch option. Mummy had a roasted aubergine dish while Daddy sampled their rabbit special with lemon sauce.",
      "The stoney beach was not the most comfortable to walk on but the water was pleasant.",
      "After our swimming we sampled a Greek inspired cocktail suggested by Galini bar staff - a raki-based mojito. I don't think it will overtake the rum-based version but it was enjoyable all the same."
