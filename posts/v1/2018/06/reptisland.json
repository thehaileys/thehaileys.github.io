      "Reptisland was small but a definite highlight of our trip. It didn't take long to drive the quiet but slightly windy roads to outside Melidoni.",
      "The setup was informal. Soon after paying our nominal entry free Daddy was presented with an incredibly cute corn snake to hold. Leo was confident to pet the snake but not to let it wriggle onto his hands.",
      "The owner gave a good overview of different animals and occassionally placed a slightly larger animal on our person. Daddy was busy holding a snake when a bearded lizard appeared on his shoulder. Daddy was upgraded from the corn snake when a larger black and orange striped snake was put around his neck. This specimen was not venomous but did attempt to constrict around the neck or hands if left unchecked.",
      "Mummy was instructed to close her eyes and opened them to find a huge frog in her hands. She already has her prince so no kissing was required."
