      "We had not booked the smallest available car because we knew we would have to fit in our suitcases plus the tandem buggy. We accepted the offer of an automatic instead of the manual that we had ordered and this resulted in an upgrade to a Jeep Renegade.",
      "Despite looking very imposing it was actually quite compact and very good to drive. We quickly got used to the automatic gearbox and eventually questioned why manual was still so popular in the UK.",
      "We found the roads quieter than expected so navigating Crete was pretty straightforward. If we needed to rely on Google's pronounciation of Greek place names then we may have struggled more (see video with sound)."
