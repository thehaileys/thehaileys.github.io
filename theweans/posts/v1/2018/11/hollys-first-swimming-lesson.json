      "Holly had her first swimming lesson today and has proven herself to be a natural water baby.",
      "From first meeting some other babies at the poolside Holly was all smiles and giggles. She seemed excited when we waded into the warm water of the Holiday Inn pool.",
      "During the class daddy and Holly bounced around the pool and sang some songs. When daddy splashed water on Holly's head she was unphased so the instructor chose her to go first for an underwater dunk. Daddy was very proud of her keeping her composure, just showing a slightly puzzled look when she resurfaced.",
      "Holly was exhausted once the thirty minutes were up but we were all looking forward to next week already."
